// Reference decoder for the Gnimu frame, v1, in plain Swift with no platform
// dependencies. The layout itself (offsets, types, scales) is in
// LayoutV1.swift, which is generated from spec/frame-v1.json.
//
// Types are marked `nonisolated` so the files also work copied into an app that
// defaults its own code to the main actor. That needs Swift 6.1 or later.
//
// A frame is accepted if it is exactly the spec's length and carries the spec
// version this decoder reads. Anything else the spec allows to vary within v1 is
// tolerated: reserved capability bits, reserved state values, and valid-mask
// bits with no field yet (a later field in a block's spare bytes takes the next
// bit, and stays v1).
